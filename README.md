# DiceRoller
Challenge project 7 in my 100 days of SwiftUI- Hacking with Swift journey. This project was the next one to build with no help from tutorials. 
This project is a simple app that allows users to press a button to roll some dice. The result is then presented in an alert, which also displays the total of the roll.
The user can edit the number of dice and the number of sides on their dice. Past results are also save and can be viewed in a list.
# Features
- Using a dice manager to ensure all views have the same information for the dice.
- Understanding ranges with foreach and when to use a tag.
- Dealing with optional values.
- Decoding and encoding to the documents directory.
- MVVM architecture.
